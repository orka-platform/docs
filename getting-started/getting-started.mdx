## How Orka works?

Orka uses a simple but powerful concept: Workflows are made up of **Nodes** that are connected by **Paths**. Think of it like building a flowchart for your business process.

## Definitions

1. **Workflows:** Complete business processes that automate a series of actions
2. **Nodes:** Individual actions or decisions in your workflow (send email, check condition, wait, etc.)
3. **Paths**: The routes that connect steps and determine the flow of your process
4. **Variables:** Data that flows through your workflow and can be used by different steps

### Example Use Cases

* **Customer Onboarding:** Automatically send welcome emails, create accounts, and assign team members
* **Order Processing:** Validate orders, check inventory, process payments, and send confirmations
* **Lead Management:** Capture leads, score them, assign to sales reps, and schedule follow-ups
* **HR Processes:** Handle vacation requests, approval workflows, and employee onboarding
* **Support Tickets:** Route tickets, assign priorities, and escalate when needed
