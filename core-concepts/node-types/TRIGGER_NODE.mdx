The Trigger Node is the fundamental starting point of every workflow in Orka. It defines how and when a workflow is initiated, serving as the entry point that determines the execution context and scheduling behavior.

## What is a Trigger Node?

* Always appears first in workflow definitions
* Defines the execution method (manual or scheduled)
